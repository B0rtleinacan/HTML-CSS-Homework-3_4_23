Refactoring code and leaving it better.

## Description 
 
 In this project, I have refactored code in the CSS file to save space and memory. 

 The problem in this project is that there were duplicated blocks in the CSS file for a few class' and id's that had the same function. The fix to this was refactoring them. One other problem with this project is that there was a missing link id in one of the div's, not allowing for every link at the top of the page to go to the correct area of the page.  
 
 I have learned that refactoring is efficiant, makes code look a lot better and run smoother. Refactoring also saves space and memory so that there is less of a chance of a memory leak.
